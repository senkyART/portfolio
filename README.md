# 🖥️ My First Portfolio Website

This is my first personal portfolio website. 
It’s a basic, clean introduction to who I am, what I do, and what I aim to achieve.

## 🔎 About

The site includes:

- A short introduction about me
- A glimpse of the kind of work I'm interested in
- A few words on what I want to do in tech

It’s just a starting point — more content and updates will come as I grow.

## 💡 Purpose

I built this to:

- Practice HTML/CSS and get comfortable with web design
- Share my ambitions in tech and development
